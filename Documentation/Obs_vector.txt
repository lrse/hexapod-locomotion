A few commentaries regarding the order of elements in the observation vector

The general structure follows the order indicated in Table S4 of the supplementary material of [1]. However, there are a few things unspecified here.

1) Joint positions/velocities: the order chosen is all joint positions first, then all joint velocities. For each of these the order is leg by leg all three joints together, in the order 'tibia', 'thigh', 'c1'. 
2) Joint position error/velocity histories: the order chosen is all data for each leg together. For each leg we have the 3 joints of the leg's position error (or velocities) in t-2, then in t-1.
3) r target history are chosen in a similar fashion: each leg together, (x,y,z) in t-2 first, then (x,y,z) in t-1.
